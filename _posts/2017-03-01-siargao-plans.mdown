I'm currently planning to explore Siargao for 1 week. Then if internet is stable, I'll probably plan for a month stay on the island. It's been a dream for me to stay in a different location for more than a week. Solo or group travel is fine. Flights to Siargao costs around 6-10k. A week stay could cost aorund 8-20k depending on your preferences. So if you would like to go and visit Siargao, feel free to contact me. I would love to have someone go with me in the beautiful island.
