Let me tell you a story.

Here's what I usually do. For the previous months, my work schedule starts at 10 in the morning and ends at 7 in the evening. For 5 days in a week, that is the schedule that I have to follow. Since I am a freelancer also, I do have side projects that needs to be completed within the timeline given by the clients. Everyday, I spend more than 8 hours of coding, both back-end and front-end. The best part of my life is still having time for myself, my family and my partner.

Programming is always fun for me. I enjoy it too much that everyday I think of something new to learn and develop. My goal is to be able to learn several ways of building things. This goal gives me a boost among others. I learned not to be dependent on one thing. Be better at something, and get yourself learning a new one. But of course, we do feel tired most of the time. Once I stop coding, I will always end up watching a series or playing a game. Until now, I love to play Counter Strike even if I'm not very good at it. I know that I won't be a professional with CS:GO, but I do watch tournaments and get to know the strategies they are doing.
